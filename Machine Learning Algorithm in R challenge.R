# Machine Learning Algorithm: Linear Regression

#Step 1: load the dataset
data(mtcars)

#Step 2: Splie the dataset into training and testing sets
#Set a random seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

#Generate random indices for training set
train_indices <- sample(1:nrow(mtcars), 0.7*nrow(mtcars))

#Create the training set
train_data <- mtcars[train_indices, ]

#Create the testing set
test_data <- mtcars[-train_indices, ]

#Step 3: Train the model
#Linear regression mode with 'mpg' as the target variable
model <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = train_data)

#Step 4: Make predictions on the test set
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test_data)

#Step 5: Evaluate the model
#Mean squared error
mse <- mean((test_data$mpg - predictions)^2)
cat("Mean Sqaured Error:", mse)

#Step 6: Use the trained model for making predictions on new data
#Select the first 5 rows as new data for prediction
new_data <-mtcars[1:5, ]
new_predictions <- predict(model, newdata = new_data)
